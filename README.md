# bettercmd
A better cmd.py

## Purpose
I love writing interactive command line programs and there's lots of uses for them but often it's hard to get the stuff you want without writing your own parser.

There was a module [CMDLN](https://github.com/trentm/cmdln) which I tried that inspired this module, but it was quite old and only used optparse, not argparse for commands, and I thought I could do better. Hence bettercmd was born.

## Usage
For examples see the examples directory.
