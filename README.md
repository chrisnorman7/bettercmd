# bettercmd
A better cmd.py

## Purpose
I love writing interactive command line programs and there's lots of uses for them but often it's hard to get the stuff you want without writing your own parser.

There was one which I tried that inspired this module (and I can no longer find), but it was quite old and only used optparse, not argparse for commands, and I thought I could do better. Hence bettercmd was born.

## Usage
For examples see the examples directory.
